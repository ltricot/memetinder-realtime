# realtime-recommendation
Realtime recommender engine.

The aim of this repository is to implement a relatively simple recommender engine in python with the following
constraints:
* works in real time
* modular, for easy change (i.e. use a different database)
* depends on few libraries (cloud services constraints)
* can run on google app engine (temporary)

Work in progress.
